  /** Challenge:
   * Some children have got some pieces of candy. They
   * want to eat as much candy as they can but each
   * child must eat exactly the same amount. Determine
   * how many pieces of candy can be eaten altogether.
   * A piece of candy can not be split.
   *
   * Example:
   * Children: 3, Candies: 10
   * Each of the 3 children can eat 3 candies.
   * So the total number of candies that can be eaten
   * is 3*3 = 9. So the function calcTotalCandies should
   * log out 9.

calcTotalCandies(3, 10); // expected output: 9

calcTotalCandies(6, 25); // expected output: 24
calcTotalCandies(5, 9); // expected output: 5
calcTotalCandies(3, 2); // expected output: 0
